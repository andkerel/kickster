# kickster

Node.js + Socket.io + Express.

A tiny game as an introduction to multiuser applications and Node.js. The first participant becomes the "kicker", 
and once the chat is full, has the opportunity to kick one of their friends out of the conversation every thirty seconds. 
This friend is locked out until everyone else leaves the conversation.
Currently not online, but can be played locally from the source files if Node.js, Express, and Socket.io are installed on the local machine.

Created in collaboration with [Jennifer Vandermeer](https://github.com/vandermeerjl).
